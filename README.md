## Welcome to my <em>Energy Systems Modelling</em> Project repository!

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è About
Here you'll discover resources and find materials from an Energy Systems Modelling project made using EnergyPlus, completed during my Mechanical Engineering academic journey.

The report details the findings of simulating three scenarios for building construction using the EnergyPlus software, aimed at defining the ideal version of a house model. The building, located in Bras√≠lia, Brazil, features nine rooms and accommodates four residents. Various modifications were made to the model, which culminated in the ideal version of the building model, with reduced HVAC energy consumption and improved thermal comfort for occupants.
